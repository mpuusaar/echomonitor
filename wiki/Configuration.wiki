#summary Configuring EchoMonitor.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured,Configuration

== Introduction ==

EchoMonitor can be configured through a simple XML file _configuration.xml_ that resides in the EchoMonitor installation folder.

This document has vital information about the first-time configuration of EchoMonitor and for more advanced configuration.

== Requirements ==

 # Write access to the EchoMonitor configuration file.
 # Administrator rights on the Echo System Server (ESS) to reconfigure capture appliances.

== First-time configuration ==

Before running EchoMonitor for the first time you will need to add information about your Echo360 capture appliance(s) into the configuration file _configuration.xml_.

You can find the configuration file from the same directory where you installed EchoMonitor itself (Windows - C:\Program Files\EchoMonitor\; Mac OS X - /Applications/EchoMonitor/).

The configuration file is in XML format and can be edited with Notepad or WordPad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Mac OS X) or with your favourite text-editor.

Normally a new configuration file looks like this:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
	<appliances>
		<appliance>
			<name>My Appliance 1</name>
			<address>https://192.168.0.1:8443</address>
			<username>instructor</username>
			<password>password</password>
		</appliance>
	</appliances>
	<audioErrorLevel>5000</audioErrorLevel>
	<audioErrorLimit>20</audioErrorLimit>
	<audioWarningLimit>10</audioWarningLimit>
	<debug>false</debug>
	<defaultLocale>en_US</defaultLocale>
	<showFirstApplianceAutomatically>true</showFirstApplianceAutomatically>
	<showRoomSelection>true</showRoomSelection>
	<startFullscreen>true</startFullscreen>
</configuration>
}}}

=== Adding your appliances information to the configuration ===

You will need to edit the section between _<appliances>_ and _</appliances>_ to add your own appliances information to the configuration:
||<name>My Appliance 1</name>|| change the text _My Appliance 1_ to describe the name of your own appliance. ||
||<address>https://192.168.0.1:8443</address>|| the address in here has to be the same web address that you would use to access this appliances ad-hoc interface in the browser. ||
||<username>instructor</username>|| make sure that the username in here is the same that is assigned to the rooms _Generic User Name_ in the EchoSystem Server. ||
||<password>password</password>|| make sure that the password in here is the same that is assigned to the rooms _Generic Password_ in the EchoSystem Server. ||
