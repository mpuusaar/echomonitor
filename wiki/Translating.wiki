#summary Translating EchoMonitor.

== Introduction ==

EchoMonitor can be translated/localized into any given language really easily by editing only one simple text-file and submitting it to this project.


== Details ==

 # Get the current localization file from SVN: http://echomonitor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/EchoMonitor/src/locale/en_US/EchoMonitor.properties
 # Save the localization file to your computer and edit it according to your locale
 # Send the file to marko.puusaar@gmail.com. Marko Puusaar will send you back a compiled version of EchoMonitor with your translation so you could test that the translation is correct
 # Confirm to Marko Puusaar that the translation is working properly and it will be included to the next release of EchoMonitor
